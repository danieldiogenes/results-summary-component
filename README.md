## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I've learned

In this project I was able to exercise the use of flexbox and css grid, despite being a simple resolution application and that could be done more quickly using some library like tailwind or bootstrap, I decided to opt for a more "pure" solution using simple css.

To organize the css classes I used the BEM methodology, it is easier to understand the code when it is done using pure css, which is the pattern I intend to follow in this type of solution, I also used variables to simplify the code of the css classes and make it easier some change. I chose not to apply javascript or leave the page with dynamic data, I intend to make the project more complete in the future.
